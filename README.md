# The Rust Programming Language for Espressif chips

This fork enables projects to be built for the Xtensa-based ESP32, ESP32-SXX and ESP8266 using [Espressif's llvm fork](https://github.com/espressif/llvm-project). (RiscV chips like ESP32-CXX are already supported in stock Rust.)

Moreover, this fork enables Rust STD support (networking, threads, and filesystem) for all chips in the ESP32 family (Xtensa and RiscV), by optionally linking with the ESP-IDF framework.

The [esp-rs](https://github.com/esp-rs) organization has been formed to develop runtime, pac and hal crates for the Espressif chips (bare-metal as well as ESP-IDF based).
